Hey, Iâ€™m @c-grimshaw. I'm a hobbyist programmer and an systems security engineering officer in the Canadian military. I have a BEng and MASc in Computer Engineering, and my graduate thesis was focused on enterprise-scale anomaly/threat detection using link prediction techniques in GNNs.

I'm passionate about software engineering, cattle dogs (specifically, my cattle dog), and long distance running (specifically, running with my partner). I enjoy Go, Rust, and Python as my main programming languages.
