ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @c-grimshaw. I'm an engineering officer in the military and a MASc candidate in Cybersecurity at the Royal Military College of Canada.

Passionate about software engineering, cattle dogs (...or at least, my cattle dog, Indiana Bones...), and long distance running. Currently into TUI programming!
